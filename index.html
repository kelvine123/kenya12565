    <p>
      My name is Kelvine Inganga, and I come from Kisumu, Kenya. I am currently pursuing 
      a web development certificate at BYU Pathway. Before joining university, I served as 
      a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Liberia — an experience 
      that strengthened my love for helping others. I grew up in a large family, taking care of 
      our livestock and learning the value of hard work from my mother. Today, I am passionate 
      about using technology and education to make a positive difference in my community.
