    <p>My name is Kelvine Inganga, and I come from Kisumu, Kenya. I am currently pursuing 
      web development certificate at BYU pathway, and I also enjoy web development. 
      Before joining university, I served as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ 
      of Latter-day Saints in Liberia — an experience that strengthened my love for helping others. 
      I grew up in a large family, taking care of our livestock and learning the value of 
      hard work from my mother. Today, I am passionate about using technology and education 
      to make a positive difference in my community.
